It's still too early to tell which LLM/Ai company is going to conquer, but the customisable integrations with your Pixel Phone and Google account are what makes Gemini so amazing. If you love voice input to control your phone & brainstorm, this is for you. *Opinions relevant to time of writing*",

However if you ask Gemini something when your phone is off like play music it will ask you to open your phone and connect to what ever platform you are using. Not very useful if you want hands free in the car. If developers managed to programme Google assistant to open phone and play music without any problem why not Gemini??",

A phone's AI Assistant main important feature should be assisting the user when s/he could not or unable to pick up her/his phone, example when driving or in emergency/accident etc. Hope tech guys at Google will solve this soon.",

When I ask for lyrics, it often responds with, \"I am not capable of that,\" which is disappointing. On the occasions it does provide lyrics, they’re often inaccurate or inappropriate, which adds to my frustration. As a user, I expect reliable and correct information, especially from such an advanced AI. I hope Google addresses these issues soon to make Gemini more accurate and dependable when providing song lyrics.",

Gemini could be one of those apps if Google keep working at it and bring it to it's peak levels. They done this with Google Assistant and there is no doubt in my mind that the same can happen with Gemini. What I'm not liking here, Gemini is forcing us to replace Google Assistant with it just to simply use it, or keep trying it out from time to time to see how it's progressing.",

Each time, after changing a part of prompt to get favorite results, the app made a new mistake in somewhere else, even makes new mistakes on what it answered correctly in previous editions of the same prompt. It always ignores the details of the prompt. This app can't revise its own algorithm by itself. It's totally a dead los, the most awful AI!👎",

However, this large language model is absolutely terrible. It refuses to answer basic questions. It will respond by saying the most generic things or that answers could vary and it's all a matter of opinion and that it can't give advice... Anything but answer.. It is highly biased towards certain subjects and pushes particular viewpoints and narratives.",

Is it worth the ridiculous 20$ a month for the full version absolutely not. It should be a max of 10$ a month. They are just money hungry.

I signed up for a trial, only to find out that canceling this trial meant losing all Google One services, which I had already paid for in advance for a year. How is it fair to bundle and jeopardize an entirely separate service like Google One for a trial subscription? This feels like a bait-and-switch tactic – unfair and deceptive. Google, I've trusted your services for nearly two decades.",

A BIG issue to me tho is how it makes you unlock your phone to do just about anything when saying \"Hey Google\". ESPECIALLY in the car. I used to be able to say \"hey Google, text so-and-so\" and it would just do it, but nope, it says \"first, please unlock\".",

Everything was good until yesterday, And then today, when I opened the app to chat with Gemini, it wanted to set a reminder every single moment. I told it \"Let's talk\" and Gemini wanted to say a reminder. I told her I watched an animation recently (as always) and it set a reminder on Google workspace. I did what I always do but Gemini had a problem this morning. Please check.",

One huge drawback is the app has to be open like Assistant Ok Google. But, with Siri, she hears me on lock screen, which is SUPER HELPFUL. I have vision issues. Thanks",

Using Google assistant I used to ask for reminders and identifying songs instead of Shazam. Gemini cant identify, and requires me to use my voice to set up timers. Functionality is more important to me, but this is a chat bot, not an assistant. Literally took away the only thing that made its predecessor interesting.",

Secondly it's just simply put nowhere near as powerful as Claude and chat GPT in creativity and reasoning skills being able to process large amounts of information. However, the worst part is it's not even integrated into your Android phone I would have forgave everything else. Adding Google assistant is this redundant but I switch back.",

I got tired of having to uninstall applications to update Google apps! Glad the lowest my carrier had on this device is 256GB. I was supposed to get a free trial of the pay Gemini, but I guess since I was already a Pixel user I didn't get it. The Gemini on this device is half baked, new gimmicky tricks, but basically nothing practical or useful. So meh",

It replied it's not mainly Fords, there is a Toyota and a Suzuki. That's as much sass as im willing to take from AI. It just doesn't get what I'm asking for, it takes up too much time.",

I don't know how to explain it but, maybe it is too smalli can't be sure.",

Once you start writing you can't put in a file, so if you are asking a question and then remember you need to upload a file, u need to open a new chat to do it. 2. It doesn't have memory like ChatGPT does, so it makes it VERY frustrating when wanting information, cause you then have to restate EVERYTHING you said above. Don't get me wrong it good, gives all the information and everything, but just get ChatGPT, it's a better version.",

I asked Gemini when my Amazon packages were due and it couldn't answer. That's not surprising but that's an example of what a true AI assistant needs to do: Pull things from all apps on your phone so you can get all the info you need without opening a single app manually.",

All things which Google assistant could do. Gemini mostly used its good grasp of language to tell me in a more natural way, that it couldn't do anything I asked it to do. On my phone I want my assistant to be geared towards common tasks effectively when maybe I can't use my hands (e.g. while driving).",

Gemini has knowledge about cutting edge topics on education to innovation. What I like best is Gemini won't do anything outside of what I ask. Example, I'm writing a research paper for psych. If I say to not basically write it for me that I want to use my own words, Gemini doesn't but instead will ask if I want this or that! It's pretty awesome 🤟 Thx a lot!",

I could give so many reasons if I wasn't limited to a 500 character limit in my review.. Its trash. Hopefully it gets better.. So funny that gemini advanced is $40 per month in New Zealand.

One suggestion for a future upgrade would be to allow users to upload PDF files or short videos in addition to images.
