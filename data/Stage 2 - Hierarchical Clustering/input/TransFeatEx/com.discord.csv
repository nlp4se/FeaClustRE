Sometimes it will accept a 40 mb video other times it'll refuse a 25 mb one even after compression. I mean come on you guys could make a auto compress so it sends or just say from the start that it's too big instead of slowly uploading then saying it's too big after 20 minutes. Also uploading anything bigger than a MB will take forever. 3 vids of 1 MB took like 10 minutes on WiFi or on mobile data,"Thanks for reaching out to us!
